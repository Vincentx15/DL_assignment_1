# Cats and Dogs Kaggle

## Directory structure

We separated the source code from the rest of the material (such as the dataset or results from experiment).

The source code, that explains how to run the code, can be found in the [`src/` folder](src/).

In order to run an experiment properly, you will need to add the dataset in the `data/` directory. During training, the code will dump logs into the `logs/` directory, and will create a experiment folder in the `results/` directory, in which the best model from the experiment will be saved.

Some notebooks can be found in the `notebooks/` directory.
